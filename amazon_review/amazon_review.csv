"This truck is perfect for our grandson! He loves it! It's very sturdy and I am not worried that if he's rough with it, it won't fall apart. This was a great purchase! I highly recommend this if you are looking for a simple dump truck for the little guys.",Lil Bit of Sassiness,5.0,"October 30, 2019",United States,20
"The title of the review pretty much sums this up. It's a good, durable toy for our toddler who enjoys playing outside with his construction toys. It's just like right size - not too big or too small and can take the dirt & abuse a typical toddler will throw (sometimes literally) at it.",Janos,5.0,"May 4, 2020",United States,11
I was kinda skeptical due to the price but I am amazed this dumptrucknks great it's really well made In my opinion it surpasses Tonka,Billy  Rhoton,5.0,"December 14, 2019",United States,13
"Our little one really enjoys this big dump truck. It has held up well though some rough play and is still Going strong.It’s not super big so it’s easy to store, it holds quite a bit (not as much as a Tonka) but many match box cars and other toys to haul around. (We haven’t played in the dirt with it but I’m sure it would hold up just fine) easy to clean, no sharp edges.",Kate,5.0,"January 10, 2020",United States,5
"my son loves to take this outside in the yard. I don't have to worry about it getting dirty. It hoses off easy and the simple construction is surprisingly sturdy. Great find for the price. ( its all plastic, not metal )",K,5.0,"February 29, 2020",United States,6
"The CAT Bulldozer is good looking, but the treads don't move, and the bucket on the front barely moves. It all looks like it would move, but it doesn't, and I get the sense that if my toddler pulls at the bucket enough, it will break off. He was so excited when he got it (obsessed with bulldozers, asks for them every day), but with this toy he was over it in just a couple of days, and now it sits collecting dust. Invest in construction toys that actually function.",D.R.,3.0,"August 24, 2020",United States,2
"Was expecting it to be larger, but I didnt check the size in the description so thats bad on me! It is made of what seems to be flimsy plastic, has lived up to my 2 year old grandson for a few hours so far. We will see if it continues to hold up.",Rachel,3.0,"December 9, 2019",United States,3
Good dump truck for kids. My little one loves pushing it around.,Chase kacsor,5.0,"September 7, 2020",United States,4
"My 2 year old son loves this toy and plays with it all the time. We have a matching dump truck, and he will play with the two for easily an hour straight, picking things up with the digger and dumping them in the dump truck. My only complaint is that after SEVERAL uses, the bucket does not stay as strong and dumps itself if it gets too heavy (it only stays in place with plastic and the plastic wore down - I feel that if they used a different piece it would last longer).",Kel,5.0,"January 19, 2021",United States,0
"This is a gift for my grandson who is turning 3. He loves his trucks and I think this one is going to be a huge hit with him. Its the perfect size for toddler hands. So many moving parts and it will be perfect for both outside and inside play. Well made, I love that it resembles the big clunky metal trucks but that its made of sturdy plastic.  Highly recommend this. Planning to go back and purchase more from this line of toy trucks for my grandson for Christmas.",Tammy2566,5.0,"July 31, 2020",United States,0

It has held up well though some rough play and is still Going strong.It’s not super big so it’s easy to store, it holds quite a bit (not as much as a Tonka) but many match box cars and other toys to haul around. (We haven’t played in the dirt with it but I’m sure it would hold up just fine) easy to clean, no sharp edges.",Kate,5.0,"January 10, 2020",United States,5
"my son loves to take this outside in the yard. I don't have to worry about it getting dirty. It hoses off easy and the simple construction is surprisingly sturdy. Great find for the price. ( its all plastic, not metal )",K,5.0,"February 29, 2020",United States,6
"The CAT Bulldozer is good looking, but the treads don't move, and the bucket on the front barely moves. It all looks like it would move, but it doesn't, and I get the sense that if my toddler pulls at the bucket enough, it will break off. He was so excited when he got it (obsessed with bulldozers, asks for them every day), but with this toy he was over it in just a couple of days, and now it sits collecting dust. Invest in construction toys that actually function.",D.R.,3.0,"August 24, 2020",United States,2
"Was expecting it to be larger, but I didnt check the size in the description so thats bad on me! It is made of what seems to be flimsy plastic, has lived up to my 2 year old grandson for a few hours so far. We will see if it continues to hold up.",Rachel,3.0,"December 9, 2019",United States,3
Good dump truck for kids. My little one loves pushing it around.,Chase kacsor,5.0,"September 7, 2020",United States,4
"My 2 year old son loves this toy and plays with it all the time. We have a matching dump truck, and he will play with the two for easily an hour straight, picking things up with the digger and dumping them in the dump truck. My only complaint is that after SEVERAL uses, the bucket does not stay as strong and dumps itself if it gets too heavy (it only stays in place with plastic and the plastic wore down - I feel that if they used a different piece it would last longer).",Kel,5.0,"January 19, 2021",United States,0
"This is a gift for my grandson who is turning 3. He loves his trucks and I think this one is going to be a huge hit with him. Its the perfect size for toddler hands. So many moving parts and it will be perfect for both outside and inside play. Well made, I love that it resembles the big clunky metal trucks but that its made of sturdy plastic.  Highly recommend this. Planning to go back and purchase more from this line of toy trucks for my grandson for Christmas.",Tammy2566,5.0,"July 31, 2020",United States,0
"This truck is perfect for our grandson! He loves it! It's very sturdy and I am not worried that if he's rough with it, it won't fall apart. This was a great purchase! I highly recommend this if you are looking for a simple dump truck for the little guys.",Lil Bit of Sassiness,5.0,"October 30, 2019",United States,20
"The title of the review pretty much sums this up. It's a good, durable toy for our toddler who enjoys playing outside with his construction toys. It's just like right size - not too big or too small and can take the dirt & abuse a typical toddler will throw (sometimes literally) at it.",Janos,5.0,"May 4, 2020",United States,11
I was kinda skeptical due to the price but I am amazed this dumptrucknks great it's really well made In my opinion it surpasses Tonka,Billy  Rhoton,5.0,"December 14, 2019",United States,13
