"This truck is perfect for our grandson! He loves it! It's very sturdy and I am not worried that if he's rough with it, it won't fall apart. This was a great purchase! I highly recommend this if you are looking for a simple dump truck for the little guys.",Lil Bit of Sassiness,5.0,"October 30, 2019",United States,20
"The title of the review pretty much sums this up. It's a good, durable toy for our toddler who enjoys playing outside with his construction toys. It's just like right size - not too big or too small and can take the dirt & abuse a typical toddler will throw (sometimes literally) at it.",Janos,5.0,"May 4, 2020",United States,11
I was kinda skeptical due to the price but I am amazed this dumptrucknks great it's really well made In my opinion it surpasses Tonka,Billy  Rhoton,5.0,"December 14, 2019",United States,13
"Our little one really enjoys this big dump truck. It has held up well though some rough play and is still Going strong.It’s not super big so it’s easy to store, it holds quite a bit (not as much as a Tonka) but many match box cars and other toys to haul around. (We haven’t played in the dirt with it but I’m sure it would hold up just fine) easy to clean, no sharp edges.",Kate,5.0,"January 10, 2020",United States,5
"my son loves to take this outside in the yard. I don't have to worry about it getting dirty. It hoses off easy and the simple construction is surprisingly sturdy. Great find for the price. ( its all plastic, not metal )",K,5.0,"February 29, 2020",United States,6
"The CAT Bulldozer is good looking, but the treads don't move, and the bucket on the front barely moves. It all looks like it would move, but it doesn't, and I get the sense that if my toddler pulls at the bucket enough, it will break off. He was so excited when he got it (obsessed with bulldozers, asks for them every day), but with this toy he was over it in just a couple of days, and now it sits collecting dust. Invest in construction toys that actually function.",D.R.,3.0,"August 24, 2020",United States,2
"Was expecting it to be larger, but I didnt check the size in the description so thats bad on me! It is made of what seems to be flimsy plastic, has lived up to my 2 year old grandson for a few hours so far. We will see if it continues to hold up.",Rachel,3.0,"December 9, 2019",United States,3
Good dump truck for kids. My little one loves pushing it around.,Chase kacsor,5.0,"September 7, 2020",United States,4
"My 2 year old son loves this toy and plays with it all the time. We have a matching dump truck, and he will play with the two for easily an hour straight, picking things up with the digger and dumping them in the dump truck. My only complaint is that after SEVERAL uses, the bucket does not stay as strong and dumps itself if it gets too heavy (it only stays in place with plastic and the plastic wore down - I feel that if they used a different piece it would last longer).",Kel,5.0,"January 19, 2021",United States,0
"This is a gift for my grandson who is turning 3. He loves his trucks and I think this one is going to be a huge hit with him. Its the perfect size for toddler hands. So many moving parts and it will be perfect for both outside and inside play. Well made, I love that it resembles the big clunky metal trucks but that its made of sturdy plastic.  Highly recommend this. Planning to go back and purchase more from this line of toy trucks for my grandson for Christmas.",Tammy2566,5.0,"July 31, 2020",United States,0
"My two year old adores it. I had gotten him a different one for Christmas he loved but the back part where the stuff goes into, not sure what it's called, the container I guess? It keeps popping off every ten seconds so half of the play was mama help put it together.This one has had zero issues! He's rough as heck with real rocks and dirt outside while I'm gardening and we've had not one problem. When it's super dirty, I just hose it off and it's good as new again",Stephanie,5.0,"April 10, 2021",United States,0
"It is decent, but the bucket is very loose so it won't pick anything up using that handle. You have to hand manipulate the bucket which I wasn't too impressed with and is a little more difficult... no point for the handle on the boom. Other than that it seems pretty durable and fine. I got it because I thought it would be fun for my son to play with in the sandbox or his blocks to pick them up and move them around, but even though he still likes playing with it he doesn't play with it near as much as the dump truck which actually functions fine... the loose bucket is really my only complaint.",SAL,3.0,"May 23, 2021",United States,0
These toys are made out of pretty durable plastic that should hold up for light to medium use in a sandbox (as if any kid would keep it at that). I bought these for a child that was a year old at the time; something fun for him to play with on the floor. They are good toys for toddlers and younger children. I felt that they were a pretty good value for the price.,Kindle Customer,5.0,"February 11, 2021",United States,0
I ordered this to Laos with snacks for a construction themed birthday party. My son loves this toy! So light weight and easy for him to carry around. Definitely worth it and a great price!,RBG,5.0,"November 12, 2019",United States,2
"Pros: It's durable and seems to be well made. For the price point it's worth it.Cons: We bought this because he lost his MTC brand excavator when we went out of town. The MTC has electronic sounds, lights, rubber wheels, more points of articulation and geared movement...for a very similar price point.I specifically bought this one because my son loves playing in dirt and sand. The handle makes it seem like it would be good for digging. It's purely cosmetic. The shovel/bucket is loose preventing him from digging with the handle without also holding the bucket...defeating the purpose.Conclusion: Pay a little more and get an MTC excavator. Way worth it.",Eric M.,2.0,"April 18, 2021",United States,0
My toddler has been learning abut trucks and construction vehicles and he loves them so much so I decided to ordered him some of his own construction vehicles and got him this dump truck. He loves it so much but I was kinda expecting it to be a bit bigger than it is. It is smaller than the pictures they advertised the little boy playing with it.,Mai,4.0,"June 3, 2020",United States,0
"3 year old loves this dump!  He can dissemble it and reassemble, pieces do snap apart with pressure.  He likes to take things apart.  This is perfect for him because he can put it back together and has played for hours!  Very durable, easy turning wheels.  Great value!",Helen Duhan,5.0,"December 2, 2020",United States,0
"Our grandson loves to dig in the dirt, load up his construction toys, and deposit the cargo.  Then back to the dirt.  So far, this is holding up well.  It’s also fun to push and run with.  During this pandemic, we’re looking for outdoor toys, and this fits the bill!",Bargain shopper,5.0,"December 3, 2020",United States,0
"I got this to replace a broken front-end loader mini-toy for my son. We have a set of small CAT trucks, and I didn't check the dimensions of this - it's way bigger than I expected! Got it for a great price, so I'm not complaining. I think he'll like it!",jillellen,5.0,"March 11, 2021",United States,0
